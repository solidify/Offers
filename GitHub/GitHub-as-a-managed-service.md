# GitHub as a managed service
\
## Overview\
\
GitHub as a managed service is a virtual DevOps team that consists of specialists with years of experience from working with DevOps concepts in general and GitHub as platform specifically. 

Instead of having a support team of your own with hard to find specialists, you extend your team and get instant access to an entire team with a broad variety of DevOps and developer tools competencies â€“ all to a lower cost.
The goal is to help your team gain and maintain software excellence with as low impact as possible to your software delivery. To achieve that, your team needs to work on areas where their core competencies are and with a support team from Solidify.
